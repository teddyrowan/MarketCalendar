# MarketCalendar/MarketCalendar

This package `MarketCalendar` is an Objective-C class that provides an array containing all open trading days for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Specifically, it provides the data removing weekends and trading holidays to allow the programmer to easily track the trading days in any region of time. 

The data is included from the start of 2019 until the end of 2025. I think this is a useful range, 2 years of history and 3 years into the future, but if anyone should require more data the range can be expanded.
